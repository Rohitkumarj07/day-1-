# Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript #   
* Object in the javascript is the datatype which contain any combination of  primitive data-types and reference data-types.   
* objects are  different from the primitive data-types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) is that these primitive data-types all store in a single value of each.   
* Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference to that value.   
* Every object has in the form of key: value pairs.   
* The object can be created in the form of  curly braces.   
* The key and the value will be stored inside the curly braces.   
* For example:   
  let bus= {name:'benze', model:'Aircondition', showroom:'vellore'}
